# Deployment Instructions

## GitHub Actions Setup

To enable automatic deployment to Vercel via GitHub Actions, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Required Secrets

1. **VERCEL_TOKEN**: Your Vercel API token
   - Go to [Vercel Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
   - Create a new token
   - Add it as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN`

2. **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Your Vercel organization ID
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Find the Organization ID in the project settings
   - Add it as a secret named `VERCEL_ORG_ID`

3. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: Your Vercel project ID
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Find the Project ID in the project settings
   - Add it as a secret named `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

### How to Add Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with the name and value

## Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or using Vercel CLI directly:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Workflows

Two GitHub Actions workflows are set up:

1. **deploy.yml**: Uses the amondnet/vercel-action
2. **vercel-deploy.yml**: Uses Vercel CLI directly

Both will trigger on pushes to the main branch and deploy to production.
